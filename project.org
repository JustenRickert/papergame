* Idea
The idea is to come up with a really great browser game written in Typescript.
Thus far the game contains:
- [X] Circles that can move around on the page

* Plan
I am hoping to have it so that there can be two sides, each starting on the
opposing side of the map, that will have attacking units. Thus I will need to
implement
- [ ] Friendly units
- [ ] Enemy units
- [ ] A dialog that allows friendly units and enemy units to interact.
